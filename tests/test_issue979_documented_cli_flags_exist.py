"""#979 — docs/commands.md and docs/training.md documented four
``soup train --minillm-*`` flags that were never wired as CLI options; only
``training.minillm_enabled`` and friends exist, as ``soup.yaml`` fields. A
user who copied the documented command got ``No such option`` and exit 2.

Nothing checked documented flags against the live Typer tree, so this guards
the class of bug rather than just the four instances: it walks ``soup
train``'s real options and fails if a doc names one that does not exist.

Scoped to ``soup train`` and to ``docs/commands.md`` / ``docs/training.md``,
the files #979 named — not the whole CLI surface. Building this turned up
several more pre-existing mismatches (ULD strategy, RL mid-epoch checkpoint
flags, echo-trap flags, ``--output``). #997 rewrote those sites to use the
real YAML fields, so there are no grandfathered exceptions left: every flag
found by this walker must exist in the live command tree.
