"""Tests for `scripts/sync_recipe_count.py` (#1016).

The rewriter is driven by the same `DOC_SITES` table the checker in
`tests/test_recipe_count_is_synced.py` reads, so these tests exercise the
substitution logic directly against synthetic `tmp_path` files rather than
the real repo tree: the real tree is already covered end-to-end by
`test_recipe_count_is_synced.py` itself.

Fixtures here state 200, never the live catalog count. A synthetic count that
happens to equal `len(RECIPES)` is flagged by `find_undeclared_count_sites`
the moment the file is tracked, and rightly so: it cannot tell a fixture from
a new documentation site. `TestTheGuardHasTeeth` uses 200/199/144 for the
same reason.
