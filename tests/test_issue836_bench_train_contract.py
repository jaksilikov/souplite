"""#836 — a throughput number carries no evidence that the model was training.

The report builder here is deliberately pure: step times, token counts and the
three hard failure checks are plain Python, so every case below runs on CPU with
no trainer, no GPU and no model. The callback that feeds it only collects.

The three checks exist because each catches something the others cannot:

* ``grad_norm == 0`` catches the published-benchmark failure this issue cites,
  but only when the backend reports a norm at all -- MLX deliberately does not,
  and ``monitoring/callback.py:115`` initialises ``_last_grad_norm = 0.0``, so
  "absent" and "genuinely zero" are the same value there.
* The parameter fingerprint check is backend-independent and catches the MLX and
  DeepSpeed cases, where no norm is logged.
* The trainable-parameter check catches the case where neither of the others can
  fire usefully, because nothing was ever going to move.
