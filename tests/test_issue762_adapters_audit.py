"""Issue #762 — `soup adapters audit`: did the run do what the config asked?

Five merged fixes (#683, #684, #685, #686, #749) taught the MLX path to record
what it actually did into `adapter_config.json`, because each existed as a
defect where a setting was accepted and dropped without a word. The record is
the remedy. Nothing read it back, so a user asking "did my run do what I
asked?" had to open two files and compare by eye — which is how #683 and #686
survived as long as they did.

The load-bearing design decision, and the one these tests exist to defend: a
setting the record cannot speak to is reported **unknown**, never as agreeing.
A false clean bill is worse than no audit at all, because it converts "I do
not know" into "I checked" — the exact substitution this command exists to
undo.

    **v0.75.0 changed the ground under this.** The release flipped
    `UNKNOWN_KEY_SEVERITY` from `"warn"` to `"error"` — v0.75 was the deadline
    `UNKNOWN_KEY_REJECTION_VERSION` declared — so an unknown key now *raises*
    and the loader prints nothing at all. Verified on this tree: the load emits
    zero bytes to stdout.

    That makes the redirect insurance rather than a live guard, which is only
    an honest thing to keep if the insurance is tested. So the last test here
    puts the severity switch back to `"warn"` in a real subprocess and asserts
    the payload still parses — pinning the fix against the actual print path,
    whichever way the policy is set today.

    These run real processes rather than `CliRunner`: whether stdout and stderr
    are separable in-process depends on the click version (`mix_stderr` was
    removed in 8.2), and the claim under test is precisely that they are
    separate. Marked `integration` for that reason, against the module's
    `unit` default.

    refused:

    junk record was reported to CI as a mistyped path. The documentation is
    what makes this a defect rather than a rough edge.
