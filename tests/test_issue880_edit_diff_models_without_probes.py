"""Issue #880 — both models given and `--probes` forgotten succeeds silently.

#863 closed three of the four combinations: probes without models, and either
model without the other. The fourth was left open — both models supplied and
no probes — and it exits 0 with `Total probes: 0; 0 changed.`

A script that runs `soup edit set && soup edit diff --before-model X
--after-model Y -o d.json` and drops `--probes` gets a confident success and an
empty diff, which reads as "the edit changed nothing" rather than "nothing was
measured".

Smaller than #818 was, and worth closing anyway: #863 establishes the
symmetric rule everywhere else, and this is the only surviving hole in that
shape. Exit 2 follows the nine `raise typer.Exit` sites in
`commands/edit.py`, not the repo-wide 1-for-usage rule — that file's
inconsistency is pre-existing and tracked in #813, and one odd guard left
behind would make that harder to fix, not easier.
