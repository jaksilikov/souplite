"""Regression tests for issue #1138: the MCP run-log append must refuse a symlink.

`ExecutionManager.execute()` spawns the child with its stdout/stderr pointed at
`.soup/mcp-runs/<run_id>.log`, opened with a plain `open(path, "ab")`. Unlike
the digest reader in the same file (hardened in v0.75.1) and the audit log
(`open_no_follow` since #820), that open followed symlinks: a link planted at
the log path redirected every byte the child wrote to the link target.
