"""#761: ``data.mask_history`` was declared, validated, documented — and read by
nothing, so a config that asked to train on the last turn trained on every turn.

The maintainer's ruling (2026-09-18) was to wire it, not to refuse it: the
machinery for excluding spans from the loss already exists in ``data/loss_mask.py``
and ``train_on_responses_only`` is the worked example one axis over.

These tests count **trained tokens**, never a flag. The precedent is v0.73.3, where
an assistant-only label mask built from a mapping's key strings produced 0 trained
tokens, showed an ordinary loss curve, and raised nothing: a boolean assertion
would not have caught it.

Both label-building branches are covered. ``build_assistant_only_labels`` prefers
the template's own ``{% generation %}`` mask and falls back to incremental
rendering when the template has none, and the two reach the labels by different
code, so ``mask_history`` has to be applied on both.
