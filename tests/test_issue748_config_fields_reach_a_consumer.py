"""Issue #748 — a config field that reaches no consumer must fail the suite.

A field is declared in `config/schema.py`, validated, documented with a worked
example, and read by nothing. It accepts a value and does nothing with it,
silently. Searching this tracker for `ignore|silently|never read|does not
honour|no caller` returns 36 issues, among them #683, #684, #685 and #686 --
four in a single backend. Every one was found by a person reading code.

Nothing failed when a field lost its last consumer, and nothing fails today
when a field is added with no wiring. This guard closes that.

**What it does and does not claim.** It answers "does anything read this",
not "does this backend read this". `training.max_grad_norm` is read by sixteen
transformers trainers and by nothing on MLX; that is a strictly harder problem
and out of scope here.

**What this cannot see, so nobody trusts it past its limits.**

*The name space is global.* It asks whether an identifier appears as an
attribute or key anywhere under ``src/``, not whether it appears on a config
object. The consumed set is roughly 3,400 names -- most of the codebase's
attribute namespace. A field named after a common attribute therefore reads as
consumed on the strength of an unrelated one. Measured on this tree, an
unwired field would be caught or missed as follows:

    training.verbose         caught
    training.top_k           LEAKS   -- `top_k` is an attribute elsewhere
    training.top_p           LEAKS
    training.temperature     LEAKS   -- `request.temperature`, commands/serve.py
    training.dtype           LEAKS
    training.seed            LEAKS
    training.logging_steps   LEAKS

So this is a ratchet with a known hole, not a proof. It leaks hardest on
exactly the generic names a new HuggingFace/TRL passthrough field would carry,
which is the case most likely to arise. `test_the_known_leak_is_still_the_
known_leak` pins the boundary so it cannot move without someone noticing.
Scoping reads to config-typed objects is a much larger piece of work and is
not attempted here.

*Fields read only through a ``schema.py`` ``@property`` ARE now seen*, but
only when something calls the property. ``schema.py`` is excluded from the
main scan, so ``training.bnb_4bit_use_double_quant`` -- resolved by the
``double_quant_on`` property (``schema.py:1880``, #321) -- read as an orphan,
and an earlier version of this allowlist recorded it as an unread offender on
exactly that evidence. Freezing a repaired field as an open defect is the
worst thing an allowlist can do, because no test can retire it: the list is
meant to name fields a user can set with no effect, and an entry that
contradicts itself gives a false answer to the one question the file exists to
answer. `schema_property_reads` fixes it. The gate matters as much as the
pass: an UNCALLED resolver launders nothing, or the detector's own failure
mode returns one level up, with a field "read" by code that never runs.
Validators are excluded on principle -- a validator checks a value, a property
resolves one for a consumer.

*A read inside a function nothing references is not consumption* (#807), and
the gate that enforces it has limits in both directions. A field is dropped
only when EVERY read sits in such a function; one live read anywhere rescues
it, which is what keeps the impact small -- on this tree it drops exactly one
declared field, `warmup_auto`, pinned by
`test_the_real_tree_has_exactly_one_known_escape`.

"Referenced" is a syntactic question, not a reachability one, and it errs
toward *referenced* -- so distrust a pass more than a failure. Two leaks
follow. A function called only from ANOTHER dead function counts as
referenced, because the dead caller's body loads its name: deadness is not
transitive here. And the match is global by spelling, so an unrelated
`obj.name` anywhere under ``src/`` rescues a dead function of the same name.

The opposite hole is the one to watch: a function whose name is never loaded
is not referenced at all, so its reads are dropped and a live field could be
reported unconsumed. Typer command bodies are its largest decorated class
among the modules the gate scans; undecorated functions are a larger share.
`@app.command()` loads `app` and `command`, never the decorated function's own
name, so on this tree 115 of the 150 `*.command`-decorated functions are absent
from `referenced_names`, and the other 35 are present only through the global
spelling match above. A function reached only through a string --
`getattr(module, "name")`, or an entry point declared outside ``src/`` -- is the
same case. On this tree that drops nothing beyond the four above.

**Two rules this file learned the hard way, kept because they generalise.**
A check can only be pinned by testing its REFUSALS: loosening a predicate
makes a suite pass rather than fail, so `_reason_is_accountable` is asserted
against what it rejects. And an assertion that looks untestable usually is not
-- it is only unextracted. The scan/import tree check in `_declared()` was
described here as "unkillable by construction", on the grounds that it exists
to fire in a misconfigured environment and no mutation run inside a correct
one can reach it. That was true of the assertion as written and false of the
question it asks: pulling the comparison out as `describe_tree_mismatch` made
it an ordinary function over two paths, testable in both directions with
`tmp_path` and killed by three mutations. The lesson is the more useful one:
"untestable from here" is a claim about the current shape of the code, not
about the property.

*It cannot see a value that is read and then rewritten.* #423 is the shape:
``detect_device()`` did not recognise MLX, so `quantization: 4bit` was read
correctly and then silently rewritten to `none`. That needs device-aware
expectations, not a reachability walk.

**Why an AST walk and not a grep.** `citation_recall_threshold` appears in a
validator's error-message strings, so `grep -rl` calls it consumed while
nothing applies it. Docstrings are stripped before the walk for the same
reason. Conversely a field reached only through `getattr(cfg, "name")` or
`cfg_dict["name"]` IS consumed, and a guard that flagged those would be
deleted within a week -- `relora_steps` and `loraplus_lr_ratio` are exactly
that shape. Both directions are pinned below.
