"""#826 — every torchao class Soup asks for must exist in the installed torchao.

Three of the four export schemes and the whole ``training.nvfp4`` path resolved
names torchao does not export (``NVFP4Config``, ``Int8DynActInt4Config``,
``Float8DynActFloat8Config``), so a Blackwell user who set ``nvfp4: true`` got a
yellow line and a bf16 run, and three of four ``soup export --format torchao``
schemes could not build a config at all. The refusal said "upgrade torchao"
against 0.18.0, the newest release.

The reason it survived: no test used the real package. ``test_v07121.py``
injected a fake ``torchao.quantization`` defining ``NVFP4Config``, and
``test_v0531_142.py`` used a ``MagicMock``, where ``hasattr`` is true for every
name. So the checks here import the REAL torchao and skip when it is absent;
the ``torchao-contract`` CI job installs ``.[qat]`` so they actually run.
