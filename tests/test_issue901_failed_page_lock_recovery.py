"""#901 — a failed page-lock left a stale CUDA error that killed the next kernel launch.

The report: Qwen2.5-14B, ``stream_layers: true``, NF4, on an 8 GB card with 32 GB
of RAM. The pre-flight predicted a 3.39 GB peak against 7.41 GB free, the run
printed "could not page-lock the base ... falling back to a PAGEABLE RAM store",
and then died with ``AcceleratorError: CUDA error: out of memory`` inside
``SFTTrainer.__init__`` — or, with ``training.stream_vram_probe`` on, inside the
probe's first forward. Lowering ``max_length`` changed nothing.

Reproduced on the dev box (RTX 5070 Laptop 8 GB, Windows 11, torch 2.14.0+cu130)
with a synthetic Qwen2.5-14B-shaped checkpoint, then reduced to pure torch:

* ``torch.empty(N, pin_memory=True)`` for N past what ``cuMemHostAlloc`` will
  give raises ``AcceleratorError("CUDA error: out of memory")`` in 0.1 s.
* After that, ``cudaMalloc``, ``synchronize`` and a host-to-device ``memcpy``
  all succeed — but the FIRST KERNEL LAUNCH raises the same "out of memory"
  with 7.3 GB of VRAM free, and the second launch works. The failed host
  allocation leaves the runtime's per-thread "last error" set, nothing on the
  fallback path clears it, and the launch check of the next kernel reads it.
  In the report that next kernel was ``param.data.to(torch.bfloat16)``; in the
  probe it was the forward.

So the pageable fallback was dead on arrival: it announced itself and then
handed the run a poisoned context. Memory was never the problem.

There is no ``cudaGetLastError`` binding in ``torch.cuda.cudart()``, so the
drain launches one trivial kernel and lets its launch check consume the stale
error, then launches a second to prove the context is healthy. The failed
attempt's page-locked blocks also stay in torch's caching host allocator until
released, so the recovery empties that cache too: on the 14B store that is
gigabytes of dead pinned memory otherwise held for the whole run.
