"""#839: the fast-LoRA single-projection kernel and its own tests (tracker #792).

``utils/fast_lora.py`` replaces peft's generic autograd for one projection at a
time: ``Y = X @ W^T + b + s * (X @ A^T) @ B^T``, with a hand-written backward
that saves only what the backward reads. Nothing here claims a speedup; the
tracker measures before any number is published, and the tests below assert
correctness only.

Asserted on CPU (no CUDA needed):

- ``torch.autograd.gradcheck`` in float64, with and without a base bias.
- fp32 forward, input-grad and adapter-grad parity against the unpatched peft
  ``lora.Linear`` at ``assert_close`` defaults. The parity is asserted at
  tolerance, not bit-exactness: an earlier bit-exact readout was taken with
  ``lora_B`` at zero, which makes the adapter term vanish, so it measured far
  less than it appeared to. With ``lora_B`` randomised the comparison is a real
  one and the tolerance is what carries it.
- Delegation to peft's own forward: disabled adapters, merged adapters, a DoRA
  variant, non-zero dropout, and the ``adapter_names`` kwarg.
- The patched forward reads the base weight at call time (the streaming
  contract); patching is counted, idempotent and reversible.
- A 4-layer tiny Llama with 2 stream buffers: the patched streamed model's loss
  and all 16 adapter grads match the resident twin (#331 shape).
- Saved-for-backward bytes are not worse than peft's graph at the unit shapes
  (measured equal; the assertion is ``<=``).
- The kernel's own grad_fn is asserted on CPU across bias, rank, and dtypes
  (fp32, bf16, fp16, mixed), ensuring non-fp32 or mixed-dtype execution paths
  do not silently delegate.

Marked ``gpu`` (the protocol for a CUDA run; skipped in CI):

- NF4 forward/backward parity and kernel execution (asserting grad_fn is the
  kernel's autograd node, not the delegate's) against unpatched
  ``lora.bnb.Linear4bit``. The tolerance is loose on purpose: the fused-vs-dequant
  divergence #776 pins is part of whatever delta is measured there, and the honest
  magnitude needs a card.
- A micro-benchmark at the Llama-3.1-8B ``o_proj`` shape. Report, do not
  assert.

The gpu-marked tests need a card. Everything CPU above ran green on macOS with
torch 2.14.0 / peft 0.21.0 / Python 3.12 (the versions CI installs).

        """The kernel's Function node, not peft's, is what built this output.

        ``grad_fn`` is the positive edge: the name is produced by the autograd
        Function that ran, so it cannot hold when the kernel was skipped. The
        unpatched forward yields ``AddBackward0`` for the same input.

        Parametrised over bias and rank because the pin has to see a narrowed
        delegation guard, not only an unconditional one. Measured at review
        time: with both arms at defaults (bias, 2-D), three mutations at
        ``fast_lora.py:278`` all SURVIVED the suite - delegating on a 3-D
        activation, delegating for a bias-less base, and both together. The
        combination is what the kernel exists for: ``_flatten``'s own docstring
        names ``[B, S, in]`` as the transformers rank, and every ``o_proj`` call
        in a Llama is 3-D on a bias-less base. The parity tests cannot catch it
        because agreement is trivially true under delegation.
        Additionally, parametrised over dtype (fp32, bf16, fp16, mixed) because
        delegating on non-fp32, fp16, or mixed-dtype (fp32 adapters on a bf16 base,
        as left by get_peft_model with autocast_adapter_dtype=True) would otherwise
        survive both parity and gradcheck.
