"""Repo-wide ratchet: a `--help` assertion must never read RAW CLI output.

This failure has turned CI red **four times** — v0.71.26, v0.71.32, v0.71.35 and
v0.73.2, the last one on all nine test cells at once. Each time it was written
down (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING, a memory note) and each time it happened again,
which is the argument for a check that FAILS rather than another paragraph that
asks people to remember.

**The mechanism, precisely.** Typer renders `--help` through a Rich table and
styles each option name, so on a colour-capable stream Rich emits escapes
*inside* the flag::

    --noise-floor  ->  -\\x1b[0m\\x1b[1;36m-noise\\x1b[0m\\x1b[1;36m-floor

`"--noise-floor" in result.output` then cannot match. **Windows passes**, because
Rich auto-disables colour there — so a green local run on a Windows box proves
nothing about the Linux/macOS cells. That asymmetry is the entire trap.

**Scope is deliberately narrow: `--help` output only.** A flag named inside an
ERROR message is fine and is NOT flagged, because `console.print(f"... --model
...")` interpolates plain text that Rich does not style per-token. Measured
before writing this guard: 13 such error-message assertions exist across 10
files and all of them are correct. Flagging those would make this test noise,
and a noisy guard gets deleted.

**A third class exists and is deliberately NOT scanned (issue #987).** A bare
`assert "\\x1b" not in result.output` on ordinary (non-`--help`,
non-highlighted) CLI output is environment-dependent: the command under test
prints through an unpinned module-level `Console()`, so under
`FORCE_COLOR=1 TERM=xterm-256color` Rich styles the *surrounding* panel markup
and the assertion fails even when the untrusted field itself was sanitised
correctly. The fix is per-test Console pinning::

    monkeypatch.setattr(mod, "console", Console(force_terminal=False))

`no_color=True` alone is NOT sufficient — it suppresses colour but does not pin
tty detection, which is why `test_replay.py` carried that exact bug.

**Why this is not automated.** These assertions split roughly half and half
between ones reading CLI output and ones reading a pure-function return
(`_safe_md_cell(...)`, `_yaml_dq(...)`, `str(exc.value)`, a `cleaned` local, a
`messages[0]`). No exact count is quoted here on purpose: four AST definitions
of "such an assertion" gave four different totals, so any number would be an
artefact of its matcher. The ratio survives every definition, and the ratio is
what the argument needs. A scanner rule for this class must tell those two
kinds apart, and at a roughly even split a rule that cannot do so cleanly
false-positives about half of what it sees — the same "a noisy guard gets
deleted" argument made one paragraph up. The split is not academic:
`test_issue627_unknown_config_keys.py` asserts on a local named `out` that *is*
console output (a `Console(file=...)` StringIO), so name-based and call-based
heuristics both misclassify it. That distinction is left to review and to
per-test pinning, not automated here.

Seven were pinned under #987 (`test_replay`, `test_runs`,
`test_review_fixes_v07133`, `test_v07127`, `test_v07136`, `test_v07139`,
`test_issue367_ship_numerics`). `test_issue627_unknown_config_keys.py::
TestTheReportIsSafeForTheTerminal` was the same defect and was fixed
separately in #984.

CI does not go red on these today: no workflow sets `FORCE_COLOR`/`TERM`, and
`CliRunner`/`StringIO` are non-ttys, so Rich disables colour on every runner.
They are latent-until-something-upstream-changes — exactly the shape of the
four incidents named at the top of this docstring.

At the time of writing this scanner finds **zero** offenders — it is a ratchet,
not a cleanup. `TestTheScannerCanActuallyFail` is therefore load-bearing: a
scanner that has nothing to find must still be shown capable of finding
something, or it is indistinguishable from one that is silently broken.
