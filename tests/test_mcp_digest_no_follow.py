"""``digest_file`` must open with ``O_NOFOLLOW``, not plain ``open``.

``enforce_under_cwd_and_no_symlink`` is an ``lstat`` check. Between that check
and the read, a symlink can be swapped in at the same path and the digest is
then taken of whatever the link points at — the TOCTOU window the MCP plan /
execute split exists to close (a model swapped after the plan was approved).
The sibling reader ``mcp_server/registry.py::_read_text_under_cwd`` already
opens with ``os.O_RDONLY | os.O_NOFOLLOW`` for exactly this reason.

The open goes through ``souplite.utils.paths.open_no_follow`` (#820), which
refuses a symlink in its own pre-open ``lstat`` and passes ``O_NOFOLLOW`` where
the platform has one. Windows has no ``os.O_NOFOLLOW``; there the helper's
``lstat`` / reparse-point check and post-open ``fstat`` cross-check refuse
instead, so the symlink tests below are gated on being able to CREATE a symlink
(``requires_symlink``), not on POSIX. The flag test asserts the real flag where
the platform has it and the fallback where it does not.

Passing the flag is only half of it: the single-file branch used to open
``os.path.realpath(path)``, i.e. a path with the symlink ALREADY RESOLVED, so
``O_NOFOLLOW`` had nothing left to refuse and the swapped-in link's target was
digested. It opens the path as given now, and the recorded ``ProtectedFile.path``
stays the resolved one, because that is what ``_revalidate`` compares.
