"""Regenerate tests/fixtures/recipe_base_architectures.json (#1070).

Records, for EVERY base a shipped recipe names, the ``model_type`` and the
routed-expert count read off that base's ``config.json`` on the Hub.

Why every base and not only MoE ones: the first version of #1070's ratchet found
MoE recipes by their MoE *flags*, then patched in a hand-kept list of the
flagless ones it knew about. That is the same flag-blindness one level down --
a new flagless MoE recipe passed straight through (#1102 review, F3). A record
of every base, checked for completeness against the catalogue, makes a new base
fail the ratchet until someone classifies it, whatever flags its recipe sets.

It reads the raw JSON with ``hf_hub_download`` and never instantiates anything,
so it executes no remote code -- which is also why it can read a base that
needs ``trust_remote_code`` (DeepSeek-OCR) that a model build would refuse.

A base whose ``config.json`` cannot be read is recorded with the reason rather
than dropped. Anonymously that includes every gated base, so run with
``HF_TOKEN`` set to classify those; the record says which ones it could not.

Deliberately a separate, explicit step: run it and review the diff.
