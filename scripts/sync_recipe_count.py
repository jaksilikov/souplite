"""Rewrite every declared DOC_SITES count to match the catalog (#1016).

`tests/test_recipe_count_is_synced.py::DOC_SITES` is the single table that
tells `audit_doc_recipe_counts` what a synced repo looks like. This script
rewrites against that exact same table, imported rather than duplicated, so
the checker and the fixer can never disagree about which sites exist or what
their patterns are.

For each site, the number captured by `DocCountSite.pattern`'s group(1) is
replaced with `len(RECIPES)` in place, via a callable `re.sub` replacement
that rebuilds the matched text around the new number rather than substituting
the whole match outright. That preserves the surrounding wording ("List all
N ready-made recipes") exactly, and leaves an already-synced site
byte-identical.

`--check` reports what is out of sync and exits 1 without writing anything.
With no flag, it writes the fix and prints a per-file summary of how many
lines changed. Either way, it exits 0 when every declared site already
matches the catalog.

This script deliberately does NOT rewrite `EXPECTED_RECIPE_COUNT` in
`tests/recipe_count.py`. That literal is the milestone pin: a maintainer
deciding the catalog has reached a size worth recording, not a side effect of
running a script. Deriving it from `len(RECIPES)` would reduce the four
milestone assertions to `len(RECIPES) == len(RECIPES)`, which can never
fail. So adding a recipe is one number, edited by hand, plus one command.
