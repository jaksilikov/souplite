"""FP8 training — 8-bit floating point training via torchao/transformer_engine.

FP8 training on Hopper (H100, H200) and Blackwell (B100, B200) GPUs uses 8-bit
floating point for matmuls, giving ~2x speedup vs bf16 at comparable quality.

This extends the existing int8-QAT infrastructure (``utils/qat.py``). When the
user sets ``quantization_aware: 'fp8'`` in soup.yaml the FP8 recipe is applied;
``quantization_aware: true`` keeps the legacy int8 QAT path.

Requires:
- NVIDIA Ada or newer GPU (SM 8.9+) — RTX 40/50-series, L4, L40S, H100, H200,
  B100, B200. Rowwise recipes also need a torch that dispatches their kernel on
  the card (Ada >= 2.7, RTX 50 >= 2.8, 11.x >= 2.10) and never run on Windows
  (#835).
- torchao (the floor is TORCHAO_MIN_VERSION in utils/torchao_compat.py, #826)
  OR transformer-engine >= 1.0
- CUDA 12.0+

# (identical at v2.4.0, v2.6.0, v2.7.0, v2.13.0).
#
# Rowwise recipes run a CUTLASS kernel in ``RowwiseScaledMM.cu``, which has two
# separate gates:
#
# * a BUILD gate, ``BUILD_ROWWISE_FP8_KERNEL``, defined only when
#   ``!USE_ROCM && !_WIN32`` (every release through v2.14.0) and, before v2.11.0,
#   ``CUDA_VERSION >= 12000``. Without it, ``f8f8bf16_rowwise`` raises "Rowwise
#   scaling is not currenlty supported on your device" on EVERY device -- the
#   message names the device but the refusal is the build's. So rowwise never
#   runs on Windows, and never on a CUDA 11 build of torch before 2.11.
# * a DEVICE dispatch, first added in v2.7.0: ``sm89 || sm9x || sm10x``, then
#   ``sm12x`` in v2.8.0 and ``sm11x`` in v2.10.0 (still the full list at
#   v2.14.0). Any other major raises "Rowwise scaling is not currently supported
#   on your device" at the first forward.
#: TRANSCRIBED from torch's source, not queried from torch: torch 2.14 exposes no
#: runtime FP8 capability API (no `scaled`/`float8` symbol on `torch._C` or
#: `torch.backends.cuda`), so a table is the only option short of a trial matmul.
