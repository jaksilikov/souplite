#: PEFT has no LoRA mapping for any MoE text architecture Soup ships a recipe
#: for: every ``model_type`` below returns ``None`` from peft 0.20's
#: ``TRANSFORMERS_MODELS_TO_LORA_TARGET_MODULES_MAPPING``, so
#: ``target_modules: auto`` reached peft as ``None`` and the attach raised
#: ``No target_modules passed but also no target_parameters found`` (#1070).
#:
#: Measured while building this table, and worth knowing before extending it:
#: peft's default mapping is unreachable for a MoE model whether or not it has
#: an entry. ``LoraModel._prepare_adapter_config`` applies the default only
#: ``if peft_config.target_modules is None``, and peft's MoE config conversion
#: has already replaced ``None`` with an empty ``set()`` by then. Traced on
#: peft 0.20 / transformers 5.16.1 with tiny CPU models:
#:
#:     [llama]     before=None    after={'q_proj', 'v_proj'}  -> attach OK
#:     [mixtral]   before=set()   after=set()                 -> ValueError
#:     [qwen3_moe] before=set()   after=set()                 -> ValueError
#:
#: ``mixtral`` is the one MoE ``model_type`` peft DOES map, and it fails anyway.
#: It is deliberately absent from this table -- Soup ships no ``mixtral`` recipe,
#: and delegating keeps today's behaviour rather than widening #1070's fix into
#: an architecture nobody reported.
#:
#: Each entry is the attention projections that architecture actually defines,
#: enumerated by building the base's config from the Hub, shrinking it, and
#: instantiating it on the meta device (see the PR for the probe). Routed
#: experts are deliberately absent: on ``qwen3_moe``, ``deepseek_v3`` and
#: ``deepseek_v4`` they are 3-D ``nn.Parameter`` tensors that ``target_modules``
#: cannot address at all, and adapting them is ``target_parameters`` work
