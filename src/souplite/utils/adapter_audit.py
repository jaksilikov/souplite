"""Compare a finished adapter's record against the config that asked for it (#762).

Five merged fixes taught the MLX path to record what it actually did into
``adapter_config.json`` -- #683 (masking), #684 (accumulation), #685 (grad
checkpoint), #686 (optimizer and schedule), #749 (gradient clipping). Each
existed as a defect where a setting was accepted and dropped without a word,
and the record is the remedy. Nothing read it back until this module.

**Unknown is never agreement.** A setting the record cannot speak to is
reported ``unknown`` and never ``ok``. A false clean bill converts "I do not
know" into "I checked", which is precisely the substitution this command
exists to undo -- and it is how #683 and #686 survived as long as they did.
For the same reason ``unknown`` is not a failure: an older adapter predates the
keys, which is not the user's fault. It has to be visible, not fatal.

Pure data in, pure data out: no filesystem, no console, no imports beyond the
standard library, so the comparison can be tested without a CLI or a training
run.
