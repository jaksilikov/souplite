"""Where torchao's config classes actually live, and the one version floor (#826).

Soup used to resolve torchao configs with ``hasattr(torchao.quantization, name)``
against names torchao does not export. Three of the four export schemes and the
whole ``training.nvfp4`` path asked for ``NVFP4Config``,
``Int8DynActInt4Config`` and ``Float8DynActFloat8Config``; none of those exists
in 0.18.0, the newest release. The refusal told the user to upgrade, and there
was nothing newer to upgrade to.

So each name is resolved by importing the module that defines it. A rename then
fails at a named import with the paths it tried in the message, rather than
degrading into advice that cannot work. Measured against torchao 0.18.0:

=========================  =========================================================
what Soup wants            where it is
=========================  =========================================================
int4 weight-only export    ``torchao.quantization.Int4WeightOnlyConfig``
int8-act/int4-weight       ``torchao.prototype.quantization.int4.inference_workflow``
                           ``.Int8DynamicActivationInt4WeightConfig``
float8 act/weight          ``torchao.quantization``
                           ``.Float8DynamicActivationFloat8WeightConfig``
NVFP4 export (PTQ)         ``torchao.prototype.mx_formats.inference_workflow``
                           ``.NVFP4DynamicActivationNVFP4WeightConfig``
NVFP4 *training*           ``torchao.prototype.moe_training.nvfp4_training``
                           ``.nvfp4_training.NVFP4TrainingConfig``
=========================  =========================================================

Three of those are ``torchao.prototype``, which is by definition not a promised
location, so each key carries a tuple of candidate modules and the **public**
path is tried first. A release that graduates one of these into
``torchao.quantization`` is then picked up with no change here, which is the
shape ``trainer/_trl_compat.py:resolve_trl_symbol`` already uses for the three
configs ``trl`` moved into ``trl.experimental``. The candidates below are the
paths that were probed against 0.18.0, not guesses: today the public candidate
misses for those three and the prototype one answers.

The training and export entries are deliberately different classes.
``quantize_(model, <inference config>)`` is post-training weight quantization;
only ``NVFP4TrainingConfig`` says, in its own docstring, that it "replaces
nn.Linear modules with NVFP4Linear, which quantizes all three GEMMs (forward and
backward) to NVFP4", which is what ``training.nvfp4`` promises.
