    This delegates to :func:`souplite.utils.paths.open_no_follow` (#820) rather
    than passing ``O_NOFOLLOW`` itself. The patch-release backport could not:
    that helper landed after the tag the release was cut from, so the

    with a pre-open ``lstat`` and a post-open ``fstat`` cross-check, so this
    port is strictly stronger than what shipped.

    ``O_BINARY`` (Windows-only) keeps the read free of CRLF translation, so a
    digest is the same on every platform.

    ``OSError`` propagates to ``digest_file``'s handler, which maps it to the
