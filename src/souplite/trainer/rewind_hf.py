"""HF/TRL side of the rewind flight recorder (see ``monitoring/rewind_log.py``).

Row identity comes from the train sampler (main process, consumption order); per-row
loss from ``compute_loss``, reduced from the logits TRL already computed. One
micro-batch = one record. Recorder failures never raise into training: every
unsupported configuration found so far (a resumed run, packed / padding-free
batches, missing logits, context-parallel ``shift_labels``) either disables the
recorder with one warning or falls through to the base trainer untouched.

Why the sampler and not a callback or a row-id column (all measured on
transformers 5.16.1 / trl 0.29.1, 2026-09-15):

* Stock HF ``Trainer`` does not pass ``inputs`` to ``on_step_end`` -- a
  :class:`~transformers.TrainerCallback` cannot see which rows were in a batch.
* An extra id column does not survive TRL's collator: ``compute_loss`` receives
  exactly ``input_ids`` / ``attention_mask`` / ``labels``.
* ``Trainer._get_train_sampler`` runs in the MAIN process and yields indices in
  consumption order even with ``dataloader_num_workers > 0``.

The DataLoader prefetches ahead of ``compute_loss``, so recorded indices are queued
FIFO and popped ``len(labels)`` at a time when the loss for that micro-batch runs.

``row_loss`` is plain token cross-entropy. Under ``loss_type="dft"``, label
smoothing, or a custom ``compute_loss_func`` it is NOT the loss that produced the
gradient -- it is still a consistent per-row difficulty signal, but it will not sum
to the logged training loss.

Usage from a trainer wrapper::

        attach_rewind_state, make_rewind_trainer_class,
    )
    if tcfg.rewind_log:
        TrainerCls = make_rewind_trainer_class(SFTTrainer)
        trainer = TrainerCls(**trainer_kwargs)
        state = attach_rewind_state(trainer, log)
        trainer.train()
        if (note := state.summary()) is not None:
            console.print(note)

``attach_rewind_state`` must be called BEFORE ``train()`` -- the sampler is built
when the dataloader is built.
